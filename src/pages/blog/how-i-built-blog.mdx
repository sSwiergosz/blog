Some time ago I started to think about creating my own technical blog. One of the biggest problem was to choose a tool in which the platform would be created. On the market there as many of them - Wordpress, Gatsby, Next.js, Jekyll, Hugo are only few of the most popular technologies. Each of them has pros and cons and it was difficult to select one. Then I came across a very interesting article in one of newsletters. It was about a new (another) frontend framework. What was interesting is the fact that this new tool is a static-site generator which is the perfect choice for blogging tool. I started to read more about it, digging in all of the features it provides and finally decided that it's a perfect tool for me. I give it a try and I don't regret it at all. This tool is [Astro](https://astro.build/). Let me tell you more about it - how does it work, why do I think it's super cool and why you should give it a try!

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">* * *</div>

Astro is a meta-framework and static site builder which was developed to create fast and content-focused websites. It uses **Astro Islands** which is a special implementation of [Island architecture](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/islands-architecture/). The concpet of Island architecture is very interesting and I strongly recommend reading it. It will give you an additional context which will be helpful in understanding how Astro works under the hood. To make a long story short, the main idea behind Astro Islands is to render interactive components separately among static HTML elements. By rendering islands (an island is Astro term for interactive components) in parallel and hydrating them in isolation the page speed is increasing. Components don't have to wait for others to render and don't block each other.

Let's quickly look at the basic structure of Astro component. It consists of two main secitons - Component Script and Component Template. The first one is executed only on server side and allows you to write JavaScript code. The second one allows you to write JSX-like expressions (Astro has its own template language which is superset of JSX). They are separated by three dashes `---` which are called **a code fence**.

  />

What's really important is the fact that Astro (by default) generates website with **no** client-side JavaScript. It also progressively loads only those components that are needed at the moment e.g. during the initial load, only those components that are visible in the viewport will be rendered. What's more you can directly describe how Astro should render its islands - if it should be only on client/server side, what is the priority during loading or if it loads when certain CSS criterias are met. It is possible by using these five directives:
- `client:load` - load and hydrate a component as soon as possible
- `client:idle` - load and hydrate a component after initial load is done
- `client:visible` - load and hydrate a component after it is visible in the viewport
- `client:media` - load and hydrate a component only if CSS media query criterias are met
- `client:only` - omits the server-rendering, renders the component only on client side.

For me there is a particularly one feature that is supe exciting. It's the fact that Astro provides first-class support for many popular frontend frameworks & libraries. In other words - in Astro you can use code written in React, Vue, Angular, Preact, Svelte, Solid and many more. The only thing you have to do is to install a specific plugin and that's it! It's amazing how easily you're able to integrate different components into your app. All of that is possible because Astro renders all the components to HTML at the build time and then strips out all of the JavaScript. So no matter what combination of frontend tools you'll use. It all end up as static HTML code.

Astro is great when it comes to SEO but it shouldn't be surprised since the code is statically generating. Pages built that way are blazingly fast because they're prebuilt on the server and don't have to be generated every time user makes a request. Having all of the code compilied to HTML results also in being more friendly for web crawlers. All of that means that your pagge will be ranked higher in search results. Astro is SEO-friendly out of the box. These are the Lighthouse metrics that I was able to get almost out of the box after few moments of work:

<figure style="margin: 30px 0;">
  <img
    src="/mobileLighthouse.png"
    alt="Lighthouse mobile result"
    width={720}
    height="auto"
    style="box-shadow: 0px 0px 24px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); border-radius: 10px;"
  />
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Lighthouse result for mobile</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure style="margin: 30px 0;">
  <img
    src="/desktopLighthouse.png"
    alt="Lighthouse desktop result"
    width={720}
    height="auto"
    style="box-shadow: 0px 0px 24px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); border-radius: 10px;"
  />
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Lighthouse result for desktop</figcaption>
</figure>

What I also like in Astro is its approach to styling. By default all of the styles are scoped. You simply write CSS in components file and if you want to make it global (however, it's not recommended) you can use a modifier `is:global`. There is also a possibility to style globally all of the children of your component. When you properly combine selectors and directives it becomes a powerful pattern for using CSS styles in your application. Here's a simple example how styling in Astro could look like:

<figure style="margin: 30px 0;">
  <img
    src="/astro-styles.png"
    alt="Different types of CSS scoping"
    width={720}
    height="auto"
    style="box-shadow: 0px 0px 24px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); border-radius: 10px;"
  />
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Different types of CSS scoping</figcaption>
</figure>

To sum everything up - Astro is a great frontend framework that aims to be the best player in its field. To be honest I haven't ever used a tool which is so easy to use out of the box and is so developer's friendly. The entry level is really low and you are able to achieve satisfactory results in a fairly short time. Of course when you start digging and tries to do more advanced work it's going to be more complicated but that's something good. It only means that Astro is a great choice for beginners and also more advanced engineers. I strongly recommend you to try it and play with it a little and I hope you will find it as much fun as I do.
